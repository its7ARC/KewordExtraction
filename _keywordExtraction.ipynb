      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Let a mapping f : X -+ Y be given. Here, X is a finite or infinite set, and Y is another\n",
      "finite or infinite set. A learning machine observes any set of pairs (x, y) sampled randomly\n",
      "from X x Y. (X x Y means the Cartesian product of X and Y.) And, it computes some\n",
      "estimate j : X -+ Y of f to make small, the estimation error in some measure.\n",
      "Usually we say that: the faster the decrease of estimation error with increase of the number of samples, the better the learning machine. However, such expression on performance\n",
      "is incomplete. Since, it lacks consideration on the candidates of J of j assumed preliminarily. Then, how should we find out good learning machines? To clarify this conception,\n",
      "let us discuss for a while on some types of learning machines. And, let us advance the\n",
      "understanding of the self-organization of associative database .\n",
      ". Parameter Type\n",
      "An ordinary type of learning machine assumes an equation relating x's and y's with\n",
      "parameters being indefinite, namely, a structure of f. It is equivalent to define implicitly a\n",
      "set F of candidates of\n",
      "(F is some subset of mappings from X to Y.) And, it computes\n",
      "values of the parameters based on the observed samples. We call such type a parameter\n",
      "type.\n",
      "For a learning machine defined well, if F 3 f, j approaches f as the number of samples\n",
      "increases. In the alternative case, however, some estimation error remains eternally. Thus,\n",
      "a problem of designing a learning machine returns to find out a proper structure of f in this\n",
      "sense.\n",
      "On the other hand, the assumed structure of f is demanded to be as compact as possible\n",
      "to achieve a fast learning. In other words, the number of parameters should be small. Since,\n",
      "if the parameters are few, some j can be uniquely determined even though the observed\n",
      "samples are few. However, this demand of being proper contradicts to that of being compact.\n",
      "Consequently, in the parameter type, the better the compactness of the assumed structure\n",
      "that is proper, the better the learning machine. This is the most elementary conception\n",
      "when we design learning machines .\n",
      "\n",
      "1.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Universality and Ordinary Neural Networks\n",
      "Now suppose that a sufficient knowledge on f is given though J itself is unknown. In\n",
      "this case, it is comparatively easy to find out proper and compact structures of J. In the\n",
      "alternative case, however, it is sometimes difficult. A possible solution is to give up the\n",
      "compactness and assume an almighty structure that can cover various 1's. A combination\n",
      "of some orthogonal bases of the infinite dimension is such a structure. Neural networks 1 ,2\n",
      "are its approximations obtained by truncating finitely the dimension for implementation.\n",

      "A main topic in designing neural networks is to establish such desirable structures of 1.\n",
      "This work includes developing practical procedures that compute values of coefficients from\n",
      "the observed samples. Such discussions are :flourishing since 1980 while many efficient methods have been proposed. Recently, even hardware units computing coefficients in parallel\n",
      "for speed-up are sold, e.g., ANZA, Mark III, Odyssey and E-1.\n",
      "Nevertheless, in neural networks, there always exists a danger of some error remaining\n",
      "eternally in estimating /. Precisely speaking, suppose that a combination of the bases of a\n",
      "finite number can define a structure of 1 essentially. In other words, suppose that F 3 /, or\n",
      "1 is located near F. In such case, the estimation error is none or negligible. However, if 1\n",
      "is distant from F, the estimation error never becomes negligible. Indeed, many researches\n",
      "report that the following situation appears when 1 is too complex. Once the estimation\n",
      "error converges to some value (> 0) as the number of samples increases, it decreases hardly\n",
      "even though the dimension is heighten. This property sometimes is a considerable defect of\n",
      "neural networks .\n",
      ". Recursi ve Type\n",
      "The recursive type is founded on another methodology of learning that should be as\n",
      "follows. At the initial stage of no sample, the set Fa (instead of notation F) of candidates\n",
      "of I equals to the set of all mappings from X to Y. After observing the first sample\n",
      "(Xl, Yl) E X x Y, Fa is reduced to Fi so that I(xt) = Yl for any I E F. After observing\n",
      "the second sample (X2' Y2) E X x Y, Fl is further reduced to F2 so that i(xt) = Yl and\n",
      "I(X2) = Y2 for any I E F. Thus, the candidate set F becomes gradually small as observation\n",
      "of samples proceeds. The after observing i-samples, which we write\n",
      "is one of the most\n",
      "likelihood estimation of 1 selected in fi;. Hence, contrarily to the parameter type, the\n",
      "recursive type guarantees surely that j approaches to 1 as the number of samples increases.\n",
      "The recursive type, if observes a sample (x\" yd, rewrites values 1,-l(X),S to I,(x)'s for\n",
      "some x's correlated to the sample. Hence, this type has an architecture composed of a rule\n",
      "for rewriting and a free memory space. Such architecture forms naturally a kind of database\n",
      "that builds up management systems of data in a self-organizing way. However, this database\n",
      "differs from ordinary ones in the following sense. It does not only record the samples already\n",
      "observed, but computes some estimation of l(x) for any x E X. We call such database an\n",
      "associative database.\n",
      "The first subject in constructing associative databases is how we establish the rule for\n",
      "rewri ting. For this purpose, we adap t a measure called the dissimilari ty. Here, a dissimilari ty\n",
      "means a mapping d : X x X -+ {reals > O} such that for any (x, x) E X x X, d(x, x) > 0\n",
      "whenever l(x) t /(x). However, it is not necessarily defined with a single formula. It is\n",
      "definable with, for example, a collection of rules written in forms of \"if? .. then?? .. \"\n",
      "The dissimilarity d defines a structure of 1 locally in X x Y. Hence, even though\n",
      "the knowledge on f is imperfect, we can re:flect it on d in some heuristic way. Hence,\n",
      "contrarily to neural networks, it is possible to accelerate the speed of learning by establishing\n",
      "d well. Especially, we can easily find out simple d's for those l's which process analogically\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "A method of self-organizing associative databases was proposed with the application to\n",
      "robot eyesight systems. The machine decomposes a global structure unknown into a set of\n",
      "local structures known and learns universally any input-output response. This framework\n",
      "of problem implies a wide application area other than the examples shown in this paper.\n",
      "A defect of the algorithm 3 of self-organization is that the tree is balanced well only\n",
      "for a subclass of structures of f. A subject imposed us is to widen the class. A probable\n",
      "solution is to abolish the addressing rule depending directly on values of d and, instead, to\n",
      "establish another rule depending on the distribution function of values of d. It is now under\n",
      "investigation.\n",
